## A Novel Cosmological Model Based on Inverse Suction and Anisotropic Expansion

This project presents a new cosmological model that offers an alternative to the standard Big Bang theory. The "Cosmic Osmosis" theory posits that the universe originated from a **"suction" event**, where energy from an adjacent dimension was drawn into a stratified vacuum.

The model provides a fundamental explanation for some of the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology:

- **Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry:** The theory explains the imbalance between matter and antimatter as a result of a fundamental difference in the surface tension of the primordial energy strings, which were formed from two different sides of a boundary membrane.
- **CMB Anomalies:** It provides a natural explanation for the observed anomalies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), such as the **"Axis of Evil"**, due to the anisotropic expansion of the universe caused by the initial suction event.
- **Testable Predictions:** The theory makes specific, quantitative predictions that can be verified or refuted by current and future astronomical missions, including the detection of a secondary background radiation and a unique polarization signature in the CMB.

The full theoretical document, including the detailed mathematical formalism, derivations, and a comprehensive list of predictions, is available for download as a PDF.
